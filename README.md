# Larval Dispersal App - Ecostructure  

App that leverages models of marine larval dispersal to generate visualization tools for users.  

*Core functionality:*  
  1. Allow users to view a map and choose a location  
  2. Pick where in the water column particles are released from  
  3. Pick when particles are released  
  4. Pick how long they stay in the water  
  
Users can then view an animation on the map to show where particles move over time for a given set of conditions.
